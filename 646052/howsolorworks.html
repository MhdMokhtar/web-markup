                <h3>Solar panels</h3>
                <p>
                    Simply put&comma; a solar panel works by allowing photons&comma; or particles of light&comma; to knock electrons free from atoms&comma;
                    generating a flow of electricity&period; Solar panels actually comprise many&comma; smaller units called photovoltaic cells&period;
                    Many cells linked together make up a solar panel&period;

                    To work&comma; photovoltaic cells need to establish an electric field&period; Much like a magnetic field&comma; which occurs due to
                    opposite poles&comma; an electric field occurs when opposite charges are separated&period; To get this field, manufacturers
                    "dope" silicon with other materials&comma; giving each slice of the sandwich a positive or negative electrical charge&period;

                <h3>Charge controller</h3>
                <p>
                    A charge controller&comma; charge regulator or battery regulator limits the rate at which electric current is added to
                    or drawn from electric batteries&period; It prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage&comma; which can reduce
                    battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety risk&period; It may also prevent completely draining
                    &lpar;"deep discharging"&rpar; a battery&comma; or perform controlled discharges&comma; depending on the battery technology&comma; to protect
                    battery life&period; The terms "charge controller" or "charge regulator" may refer to either a stand-alone device&comma; or to
                    control circuitry integrated within a battery pack&comma; battery-powered device&comma; or battery charger&period;

                <p>
                    A battery management system &lpar;BMS&rpar; is any electronic system that manages a rechargeable battery &lpar;cell or battery pack&rpar;&comma;
                    such as by protecting the battery from operating outside its safe operating area&comma; monitoring its state&comma; calculating
                    secondary data&comma; reporting that data&comma; controlling its environment&comma; authenticating it and / or balancing it&period;

                    A battery pack built together with a battery management system with an external communication data bus is a smart battery
                    pack&period; A smart battery pack must be charged by a smart battery charger&period;

                <h3>DC power</h3>
                <p>
                    Direct current &lpar;DC&rpar; is the one directional or unidirectional flow of electric charge&period; An electrochemical cell is a prime
                    example of DC power&period; Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire&comma; but can also flow through semiconductors&comma;
                    insulators&comma; or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beams&period; The electric current flows in a constant direction&comma;
                    distinguishing it from alternating current &lpar;AC&rpar;&period; A term formerly used for this type of current was galvanic current&period;

                <h3>Inverter</h3>
                <p>
                    A power inverter&comma; or inverter&comma; is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current &lpar;DC&rpar; to alternating current &lpar;AC&rpar;&period;

                    The input voltage&comma; output voltage and frequency&comma; and overall power handling depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry&period;
                    The inverter does not produce any power; the power is provided by the DC source&period;

                    A power inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a combination of mechanical effects &lpar;such as a rotary apparatus&rpar; and electronic
                    circuitry&period; Static inverters do not use moving parts in the conversion process&period;

                <h3>AC power</h3>
                <p>
                    Alternating current &lpar;AC&rpar; is an electric current which periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time
                    in contrast to direct current &lpar;DC&rpar; which flows only in one direction&period; Alternating current is the form in which electric power is
                    delivered to businesses and residences&comma; and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen
                    appliances, televisions&comma; fans and electric lamps into a wall socket&period; A common source of DC power is a battery cell in a flashlight&period;
                    The abbreviations AC and DC are often used to mean simply alternating and direct&comma; as when they modify current or voltage&period;
